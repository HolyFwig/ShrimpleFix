<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

## I am Amy / Lunadox, a developer mainly in HTML5, CSS3, JS, and Python. I started working on making websites using google sites in late 2020 but didn't get more serious about coding until early 2022. I slowly became more and more apart of the unblocking/proxy community and made lots of friends. I also edit and have a YouTube channel where I upload videos sometimes !!!
